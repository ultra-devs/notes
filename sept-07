I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss a matter that is of significant importance to me and my family. As you may be aware, our company has implemented a hybrid work policy, requiring employees to be in the office for three days a week. While I understand the importance of this policy, I would like to request an exemption from this mandate due to a pressing family health concern.

My wife is currently facing health challenges that require ongoing care and attention. Her condition demands constant monitoring and support, which I have been providing to the best of my abilities. However, the three-day office requirement would significantly impact my ability to fulfill my caregiving responsibilities effectively.

I want to assure you that I am deeply committed to my role at the company and take my responsibilities seriously. I have always strived to meet and exceed our team's goals and deadlines. I fully understand the need for in-person collaboration and value the team dynamics that are fostered in the office environment.

In light of my wife's health situation, I am kindly requesting your understanding and support in allowing me to continue working remotely full-time, at least for the foreseeable future. This arrangement would enable me to be there for my wife during these challenging times while still contributing to the success of our team and the company.

I am more than willing to discuss any necessary adjustments or accommodations that would ensure a seamless continuation of my work responsibilities while working remotely. This could include increased communication and availability during work hours, utilizing collaboration tools effectively, and maintaining a proactive and results-oriented work approach.

I genuinely appreciate your understanding and consideration of this request, as it would greatly alleviate the burden on my family during this difficult period. If needed, I am more than willing to provide any documentation or information to support my request.

I understand the company's commitment to its policies, but I hope you can appreciate the exceptional circumstances that have led me to make this request. Your support in this matter would mean a lot to me and my family, and it would enable me to continue contributing positively to our team's success.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my request. I look forward to discussing this further with you and finding a solution that works for both my family's needs and the company's objectives.



I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to discuss a matter that is of great importance to me and my family, and I hope you can take a moment to consider my request.

As you are aware, our company has implemented a hybrid work policy, which requires employees to be in the office three days a week. I have always valued the opportunity to contribute to the team and maintain a strong work ethic, and I fully understand the importance of maintaining a presence in the office. However, I find myself in a situation that makes it challenging for me to meet this requirement.

My wife is currently facing some health concerns that require ongoing care and attention. Her condition has recently become more delicate, and the level of care she requires has increased significantly. 
I am the primary caregiver for her, and I want to ensure that she receives the best possible support during this difficult time. 
Unfortunately, the three days of in-office work would significantly impact my ability to provide her with the care and attention she needs.

I understand the importance of being present in the office, but I am hopeful that you can consider my circumstances and grant me an exemption from the three-day office attendance requirement, at least temporarily. 
This would allow me to better balance my work responsibilities with my wife's care needs, ensuring that she receives the support she requires without compromising my dedication to my role at the company.

I am committed to maintaining my productivity and contributing to the team's success, and I am confident that I can fulfill my responsibilities effectively through remote work.
 I will ensure that I am readily available for any virtual meetings, communication, or collaboration needed to keep our projects on track.

I am more than willing to discuss this matter further and explore potential solutions to minimize any disruption to the team's workflow. Your understanding and support during this challenging time would mean a great deal to me and my family.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my request. I look forward to discussing this further with you and finding a solution that works for both my personal situation and the needs of the company.
